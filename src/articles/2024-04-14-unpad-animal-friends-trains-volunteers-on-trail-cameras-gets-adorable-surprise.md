Here at Unpad Animal Friend, we're always looking for innovative ways to improve our animal welfare efforts. This week, we took a big step forward by introducing our volunteers to the exciting world of trail cameras!

Bushnell E3 Trail camera, owned by one of our Research team member, are motion-activated cameras specifically designed for all-weather outdoor use. They're incredibly useful for wildlife observation, allowing us to gather valuable information without disturbing the animals. Yesterday's deployment served two important purposes: training our volunteers on how to use trail cameras effectively, and showcasing the many benefits they offer.

On Friday (12/04), our volunteers came together for a special session to learn about the Bushnell Trophy E3 trail camera. The Research Unit provided the training. Trail cameras, also known as wildlife cameras, are motion-activated cameras specifically designed for outdoor use. These powerful tools allow us to observe animals in their natural habitat without disturbing them. The training session wasn't just about the technical aspects of the camera. Our experienced volunteers shared valuable insights on the many benefits of using trail cameras in animal welfare work. Trail cameras can help us:

* **Track wildlife movement**: By strategically placing the camera, we can gain valuable information about animal populations and their activity patterns.
* **Monitor vulnerable species**: Trail cameras can be used to monitor endangered or at-risk species, allowing us to better understand their needs and develop conservation strategies.
* **Document animal behavior**: The unobtrusive nature of trail cameras allows us to capture fascinating behaviors that might not be observed otherwise.

While the training session only focused on the installation and configuration of the camera. The skills learned can be applied to a variety of another trail camera models. This flexibility ensures our volunteers are prepared to use this technology in various situations.

The training session wasn't just theoretical! Following the instruction, we deployed the trail camera on Arboretum Unpad. While the initial goal was to capture images of any moving objects, the first batch of photos brought a delightful surprise! The camera captured a curious little squirrel as you can see on this one.

The campus ecosystem is home to a variety of species, including squirrels. The image suggests a healthy campus ecosystem with a plentiful food source, which could also be attracting the feral dogs. Its presence does also highlight the potential of trail cameras.

Unpad Animal Friend remains committed to addressing the feral dog situation. We'll be deploying the trail camera again soon in another strategic location to capture valuable data on the feral dog movement and where it came from.  In the meantime, our volunteers are now equipped with the knowledge and skills to effectively utilize trail cameras in various animal welfare projects.

Stay tuned for further updates on our trail camera adventures!
