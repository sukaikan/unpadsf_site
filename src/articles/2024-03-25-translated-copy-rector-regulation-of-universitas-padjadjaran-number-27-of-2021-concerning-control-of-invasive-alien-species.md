RECTOR REGULATION OF UNIVERSITAS PADJADJARAN NUMBER 27 OF 2021

CONCERNING CONTROL OF INVASIVE ALIEN SPECIES

BY THE GRACE OF GOD ALMIGHTY

RECTOR OF UNIVERSITAS PADJADJARAN,

DECIDES:

To stipulate : RECTOR REGULATION CONCERNING CONTROL OF INVASIVE

ALIEN SPECIES AT UNIVERSITAS PADJADJARAN

**CHAPTER I**

**GENERAL PROVISIONS**

Article 1

In this Rector Regulation, the terms referred to as:

1.Universitas Padjadjaran, hereinafter referred to as UNPAD, is a Legal Entity State University.

2.Rector is a part of UNPAD that leads the implementation and management of UNPAD.

3.Academic Community is an academic community consisting of UNPAD lecturers and students.

4.Educational staff are community members who dedicate their lives and are appointed with the main task of supporting the implementation of higher education at UNPAD.

5.UNPAD Work Units are units consisting of bureaus, institutions, agencies, faculties, technical implementing units, and other units that manage UNPAD.

6.Ecosystem is an order of environmental elements formed by the reciprocal relationship between living things and their environment, both biotic and abiotic ones.

7.Alien species are species that are introduced from outside their natural habitats either intentionally or unintentionally, at the sub-species, variety and nation levels which include living organisms, body parts, seeds, eggs, and propagules that can live and reproduce in their new habitats.

8.Invasive Species are species, both native and alien species that colonize a habitat massively which can cause ecological, economic, and social losses.

9.Invasive Alien Species (IAS) are plants, animals, microorganisms, and other organisms that are not parts of a native ecosystem that can cause damage to ecosystems, the environment, socio-economic losses, and have a negative impact on biodiversity and/or human health.

10.Invasive Alien Plant and/or Animal Species are flora and fauna species that can live and develop outside their natural habitats, have the ability to dominate new vegetation or habitats because they are supported by environmental factors, and do not have natural enemies that have a negative impact on local species, both ecologically and economically.

11.Biodiversity is the diversity among living things from all sources, including land, ocean, and other aquatic ecosystems as well as the ecological complexes that are parts of their diversity; which covers the diversity within species and between species and the ecosystems.

12.Introduction is the entry of species of plants, animals, fish, and microorganisms into new habitats, either intentionally or unintentionally.

13.Eradication is an effort to eradicate invasive species that enter ecosystems that are not their natural habitats.

14.Risk is the chance of an unwanted event occurring in the future.

15.Risk Analysis is an analysis of the risk of the entry of invasive alien species into the territory of UNPAD and/or the spread of alien species out of their natural habitats within the territory of UNPAD which has the potential to cause damage to ecosystems and the environment and cause socio-economic losses.

16.Control is an effort to mitigate the negative impacts caused by invasive alien species, including in the form of: damages to ecosystems and the environment, economic losses, and negative impacts on human health.

17.Prevention is an effort to prevent the entry and spread of invasive alien species into ecosystems that are not their natural habitats/distributions.

18.Quarantine is a system of preventing the entry, release and spread of pests and diseases, and plant-disturbing organisms; as well as supervision and/or control over food safety and food quality, feed safety and feed quality, genetically engineered products, genetic resources, biological agents, invasive alien species, wild plants and animals, as well as endangered plants and animals that are entered into, spread from one area to another, and/or released from the territory of UNPAD.

19.Pests and Diseases are organisms that can damage, interfere with life, or cause the death of animals, fish, or plants as well as those that endanger human health and cause economic losses.

20.Quarantine Plant and Animal Disease Pests, hereinafter abbreviated as HPTH, are organisms that can damage, disturb life, or cause death of plants and animals, endanger human health, and cause social and economic losses nationally and international trade as determined by the Government to prevent their entry into, spread within, and exit from the territory of UNPAD.

21.Pests and Diseases of Quarantine Fish, hereinafter referred to as HPIK, are all pests and diseases of fish that are not yet present and/or have been present only in certain areas within the territory of the Unitary State of the Republic of Indonesia which in a relatively short time can become epidemic and cause socio-economic losses or which can endanger public health determined by the Government to be prevented from entering, spreading within, and/or leaving the territory of the Unitary State of the Republic of Indonesia.

22.Quarantine Plant Disturbing Organisms, hereinafter abbreviated as OPTK, are organisms that can damage, interfere with the life or cause death of plants, cause socio-economic losses and are not yet found in the territory of the Unitary State of the Republic of Indonesia or are already present in parts of the territory of the Unitary State of the Republic of Indonesia, which are determined by the Government to prevent their entry into and spread within the territory of the Unitary State of the Republic of Indonesia.

**CHAPTER II**

**PURPOSES, BASES, AND PRINCIPLES**

Article 2

This Rector Regulation was prepared as a reference in the prevention and control of invasive alien species that can cause harm and negative impacts on ecosystems, biodiversity, economy, and health at UNPAD.

Article 3

Prevention and control of invasive alien species are based on the protection for ecosystem, biodiversity, economy, and health.

Article 4

Prevention and control of invasive alien species are the responsibility and obligation of the academic community, as well as the education staff related to the procurement of invasive alien species at UNPAD.



**CHAPTER III**

**INVASIVE CONTROL**

Article 5

(1) The invasive species referred to in this Rector Regulation are species, both native and non-native species, which colonize a habitat massively which can cause ecological, economic, and social losses, especially at UNPAD.

(2) Invasive species based on their sources:

a. Foreign invasive species are invasive species that do not yet exist in Indonesia.

b. Domestic invasive species are invasive species originating from abroad that already exist in the country and/or native Indonesian species.

Article 6

(1) Control of invasive species is carried out by:
