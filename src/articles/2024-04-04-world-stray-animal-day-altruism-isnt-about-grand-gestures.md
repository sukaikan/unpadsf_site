Today, on World Stray Animal Day, we at Unpad Animal Friend pause to celebrate the companions who share our streets â€“ the cats napping in sidewalks, the dogs with teary hopeful eyes, and all the creatures in between. These animals, though homeless, are brimming with love and resilience.

They remind us of a beautiful truth: altruism isn't about grand gestures. It's woven into the everyday acts of kindness that transform lives. Here at Unpad Animal Friend, we witness this magic daily. Our volunteers dedicate countless hours to rescuing campus cats, providing them with medical care such as dewormers, anti-flea medications, and multivitamins.

The impact of this altruism is undeniable. Students on campus open their hearts and club homes for cats and dogs, giving them a safe haven and a chance to trust again. Local businesses donate food and supplies, ensuring the street animals have full bellies and comfortable beds. It's a community effort, driven by the simple desire to make a difference in the lives of these vulnerable animals.

As we celebrate World Stray Animal Day, we invite you to join us in this beautiful act of giving. Whether it's volunteering at your local organisation, rescueing a street animal, or simply giving foods that every bit of it counts. Together, we can create a world where every living being finds the love, care, and safe home.
